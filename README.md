# The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem --> Algorithms (analysis and design)

The goal is to implement the RSA public-key cryptosystem.

The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem is widely used for secure communication in browsers, bank ATM machines, credit card machines, mobile phones, smart cards, and the Windows operating system.

It works by manipulating integers. To prevent listeners, the RSA cryptosystem must manipulate huge integers (hundreds of digits).

The built-in C type int is only capable of dealing with 16 or 32 bit integers, providing little or no security. You will:
   1.	Design, implement, and analyze an extended precision arithmetic data type (big integer) that is capable of manipulating much larger integers. 
   
   3.	Use this data type to write a client program that encrypts and decrypts messages using RSA.
   
**Cryptosystem** mean encoding and decoding confidential messages.
